### Online Test

- Take from home test.
- [Google Kickstart.](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/5374486/dashboard)
- 3 Questions. 3 Hours. Couldn't even complete a single question.
- Attempted it in a group of 8-10 people.

##### 1. Product Triplets

- Spent Nearly 2.25 ~ 2.5 hours on this question. Still couldn't solve it for large test case.
- Brute force worked for small test case.

##### 2. Combining Classes

- Didn't even read it.

##### 3. Cave Escape

- Simple dijsktra should have solved this.
- Was getting segmentation fault. Couldn't debug it. :cry:

---

##### Experience

- Even though it was a take home test, should have done it alone or in a group of two at max.
