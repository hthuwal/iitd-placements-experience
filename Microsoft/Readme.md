### Online Test

- Platform: [Cocubes](https://www.cocubes.com)
    - Worst Platform ever
    - Can't debug your code by printing to stdout as they don't show the stdout.
    - Can't use custom test cases.
    - Your code runs on predefined sample test cases and that is the only thing you have at your disposal to check your code.
    - Code is not executed on hidden test cases.
    - Apparently the platform thinks C and C++ are one and the same.
        + Function should return ``char**`` in C++ seriously? :unamused:

- Two tests
    + 1 hour 30 minutes common coding test for both profiles.
    + Followed by 1 hour MCQ (Machine Learning) test for Data Scientist Profile.

#### Coding Test

3 Questions. All were relatively easy. They have a pool of questions from which they create sets. The same pool is used across all IITs and NITs.

1. **K group sort**

    Given an array of n elements and an integer k.

    - Group the elements in k. (n is always divisible by k). Number formed by grouping the elements will never exceed the integer limit.
    - And then sort the array.
    - Then ungroup the elements.

    Example: [1, 23, 4, 3, 8, 9] and k = 2. Grouped number are 123, 43, 89. Now after sorting, it will be 43, 89, 123. So return the array after ungrouping them as [4,3,8,9,1,23]

    - Knew this question and had thought about an approach to do it.
    - [Code](k-group-sort.cpp). Passed all the sample test cases.

2. **Delete N nodes after M nodes of a linked list**

    Given a linked list, delete N nodes after skipping M nodes of a linked list until the last of the linked list.

    - Had already practiced/coded the question.
    - [Code](https://github.com/hthuwal/competitive-programming/blob/master/gfg/delete-n-nodes-after-m-nodes-untill-end.md). Passed all sample test cases.

3. **Sum of Leaf Nodes at Min Level**

    Given a Binary Tree of size N, your task is to complete the function minLeafSum(), that should return the sum of all the leaf nodes that are at minimum level of the given binary tree.

    - Had already practiced/coded the question.
    - [Code](https://github.com/hthuwal/competitive-programming/blob/master/gfg/sum-of-leaf-nodes-at-min-level.md). Passed all sample test cases.

#### MCQ for Data Scientist

- This had around 46 MCQ from various ML field.
- Attempted 25 Questions.
- Questions were relatively easy. Only if I had revised ML :pensive:
- Need to revise ML before giving any other Data Science specific exam.
