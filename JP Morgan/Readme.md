#### Coding Round

##### 1. Mobile Numpad

|1 (space)|2 (abc)|3 (def)|
|-------|-------|-------|
|**4 (ghi)**|**5 (jkl)**|**6 (mno)**|
|**7 (pqrs)**|**8 (tuv)**|**9 (wxyz)**| 

- Given a Numpad and a sequences of key presses.
- Print all possible words from phone digits.
- e.g key press **22344**
- Possible words are **aadgg**, **aadh**, **bdgg**, **bdh**.
- Simple recursive code would have worked.
- But didn't had enough time to code it out.
- Could only write 80% of the code before time ran out.
- **Need to increase my coding speed (less bugs -> less debugging time)**

##### 2. Max path sum between any two leafs

Given a binary tree in which each node element contains a number. Find the maximum possible sum from one leaf node to another.

- [Easy Recursive Code.](https://github.com/hthuwal/competitive-programming/blob/1bcad6cebd811b5e38382f994f8a686b216b9a70/gfg/find-maximum-path-sum-two-leaves-binary-tree.md)
- Passed all sample test cases (Performance on hidden test cases is not shown by cocubes). :smiley:
