### Folder Structure Assumption

- Scripts and the corresponding data files are present in the same folder
- Name of the files should be
    + Product.csv
    + Store.csv
    + ProductStore.csv
    + Saleslog.txt

### Reading Data and Organizing

- Used Pandas to read the csvs as data frames
- Join using `df.merge`
- Join the **Product** and **ProductStore** tables on column `Product_id`.
- Join the resultant table with **Store** and **Saleslog** table on the common columns `Product_id` and `Store_id`.
- Drop `Product_id`, `Store_id`, `Sale_date` columns. (Not needed).

### Train and Test Splits

- Using `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split` to split the data into 80-20 training and test sets.

### Model

- Used sklearn MLPRegressor which is Multi-layer Perceptron regressor.
- Single Hidden Layer of size 32, adam optimizer, relu as the activation unit, MSE Loss as the loss function, threshold for convergence 1e-4
